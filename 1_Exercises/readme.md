# React &ndash; exercises &ndash; basics and JSX


Please read the following guidelines before doing the exercises.

## How do I begin?

1. [*Fork*][forking] the repository containing exercises.
2. [*Clone*][ref-clone] the repository onto your computer using the command: `git clone repository_address`.
You will find the address of the repository by pressing "Clone or download" button on its webpage.
3. Complete the exercises and [*commit*][ref-commit] changes to your repository using the commands below.
`git add filename` will add a single file which you have changed.
If you want to add all the changed files at once, use `git add .`.
Remember that the fullstop (dot) at the end of this command is important!
Next, commit changes using `git commit -m "description_of_changes"`.
4. [*Push*][ref-push] changes to your repository on GitHub by typing: `git push origin master`.
5. Create a [*pull request*][pull-request] to the original repository when you have finished all the exercises.


Remember to add comments with exercise numbers, e.g.:

```JavaScript
// Exercise 1
{ Code for exercise 1 }

//Exercise 2
{ Code for exercise 2 }

...
```
