# JSX vs. JS &ndash; exercises

### Setup

> Create a fully working environment that will allow you to write JSX files, compile them to JS files and run a working React application.
>
> Remember to:
> - Run ```npm init``` command
> - Install appropriate modules
> - Set Webpack - he first input file should be `js/exercise00.jsx` (then with subsequent exercise numbers), the output `js/out.js`

>
> **Remember to modify appropriately _webpack.config.js_ when doing exercises, so that it points to the file you are currently working on in the _entry_.**


## Exercise done with the lecturer

### Comparing the JSX and JS files (~ 5min)

In the `js/exercise00.jsx`, place code that will render on the page a `div` with the text `JSX vs. JS` in an element with the `app` id.

Compile JSX file to JS file and run your page. Check if and how it works.

Next, open `js/out.js` file in an editor and find (`Ctrl+F`) the string `JSX vs. JS` to locate your code fragment.

Are you able to tell which of the stages is represented by the code (take into account that it may be slightly obscured by using the Webpack)? What will be the next steps to display your div on the page?
