### Preparing a working React environment  (~ 10min - 15min)

Create a fully working environment that will allow you to write JSX files, compile them to JS files and run a working React application.

Remember to:
- Run ```npm init``` command
- Install appropriate modules
- Set Webpack - the input file should be `js/app.js`, the output `js/out.js`


Next, in the `js/app.jsx` file, place appropriate code that will render on the page a `h1` element with the text `Welcome to React` in an element with id `app`.

Compile the JSX file to JS and run your page. Check if and how it works.
