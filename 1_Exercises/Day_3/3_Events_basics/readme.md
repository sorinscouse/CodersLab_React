# Event basics &ndash; exercises

### Setup

> Create a fully working environment that will allow you to write JSX files, compile them to JS files and run a working React application.
>
> Remember to:
> - Run ```npm init``` command
> - Install appropriate modules
> - Set Webpack - the first input file should be `js/exercise00.jsx` (then with subsequent exercise numbers), the output `js/out.js`
>
> **Remember to modify appropriately _webpack.config.js_ when doing exercises, so that it points to the file you are currently working on in the _entry_.**
